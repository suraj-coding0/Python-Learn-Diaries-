# What is Class Method in Python? 
# The @classmethod decorator is a built-in function decorator that is an expression that gets evaluated after your function is defined. The result of that evaluation shadows your function definition. A class method receives the class as an implicit first argument, just like an instance method receives the instance 

# Syntax Python Class Method: 
'''class C(object):
    @classmethod
    def fun(cls, arg1, arg2, ...):
       ....
fun: function that needs to be converted into a class method
returns: a class method for function.'''

# What is the Static Method in Python?
# A static method does not receive an implicit first argument. A static method is also a method that is bound to the class and not the object of the class. This method canâ€™t access or modify the class state. It is present in a class because it makes sense for the method to be present in class.

# Syntax Python Static Method: 
'''class C(object):
    @staticmethod
    def fun(arg1, arg2, ...):
        ...
returns: a static method for function fun.'''

class Math:
  def __init__(self, num):
    self.num = num

  def addtonum(self, n):
    self.num = self.num +n
    
  @staticmethod
  def add(a, b):
      return a + b

# result = Math.add(1, 2)
# print(result) # Output: 3
a = Math(5)
print(a.num)
a.addtonum(6)
print(a.num)

# print(Math.add(7, 2))
