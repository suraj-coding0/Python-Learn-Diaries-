# Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and single inheritance in object-oriented programming. It is a type of inheritance in which multiple inheritance is used to inherit the properties of multiple base classes into a single derived class, and single inheritance is used to inherit the properties of the derived class into a sub-derived class.

# Example of Hybrid Inheritance 
class BaseClass:
  pass

class Derived1(BaseClass):
  pass  

class Derived2(BaseClass):
  pass  

class Derived3(Derived1, Derived2):
  pass


# Hierarchical Inheritance is a type of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming where multiple subclasses inherit from a single base class. In other words, a single base class acts as a parent class for multiple subclasses. This is a way of establishing relationships between classes in a hierarchical manner.

# Hierarchical Inheritance
class BaseClass:
  pass

class D1(BaseClass):
  pass

class D2(BaseClass):
  pass

class D3(D1):
  pass
