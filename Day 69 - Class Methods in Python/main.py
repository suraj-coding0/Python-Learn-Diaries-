# What are Python Class Methods?
# A class method is a type of method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. In other words, it operates on the class as a whole, rather than on a specific instance of the class. Class methods are defined using the "@classmethod" decorator, followed by a function definition. The first argument of the function is always "cls," which represents the class itself.


# How to Use Python Class Methods
# To define a class method, you simply use the "@classmethod" decorator before the method definition. The first argument of the method should always be "cls," which represents the class itself. Here is an example of how to define a class method:

'''class ExampleClass:
    @classmethod
    def factory_method(cls, argument1, argument2):
        return cls(argument1, argument2)'''

class Employee:
  company = "Apple"
  def show(self):
    print(f"The name is {self.name} and company is {self.company}")

  @classmethod
  def changeCompany(cls, newCompany):
    cls.company = newCompany


e1 = Employee()
e1.name = "Harry"
e1.show()
e1.changeCompany("Tesla")
e1.show()
print(Employee.company)
